name: Menu

# Now running on pull_request_target events instead of plain pull_request.
# This means the action will always run in the context of my own repo, looking only at the *menu* portion of a PR.
# I've done this to make the comment-pull-request stuff below work but maybe this is generally cleaner/better/securerer or something.
# Also it was way too much work. :(
# Some ideas taken from https://github.com/bugout-dev/locust/blob/1bebcc2cac67e90c1efb09b42c37e91cdae829f9/.github/workflows/locust.yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    paths:
      - 'menu/**'

# Skip push for now since I can't really figure out a suitable base ref?
# If I ever fix that, then the ifs below should be updated
